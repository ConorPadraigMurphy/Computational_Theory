## About this Project
This repository has been created to track the progress of my Computational Theory assignment which was worked on during my fourth year of studying Software Development at Atlantic Technological University.

This assignment involves analysing and solving Countdowns Numbers Round where the contestants are given six random numbers and mathematical operations to reach the target number within the time limit of thirty seconds.
