## About this Project

Welcome to the Computational; Theory repository. This repository was used to track the progress of my assignment that was undertaken for my Computational Theory module during my fourth year of studying Software Development at Atlantic Technological University.

The goal of this assignment is to analyse the Countdown numbers round as well as implement a Python function called `solve_numbers` that can solve the numbers round of the popular TV game show Countdown.
