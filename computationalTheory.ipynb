    "This assingment aims to solve and analyse the [Numbers Round](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Countdown_(game_show)#Numbers_Round)  of the television gameshow called [Countdown](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Countdown_(game_show)). The assignment will be broken up into two sections in this python notebook. THe first section will discuss the theory element of the Numbers round of the game Countdown. THis will involve discussing topics such as: \n",
    "    - A explanation of the Countdown Numbers Round.\n",
    "    - The analysis of the computational complexity of the round.\n",
    "    - An explanation of the approach taken in this assignment to solve the game.\n",
    "    - And lastly, the findings on the research of the problem done during this assignment.\n",
    "The second section of this notebook is on the implementation element and will involve:\n",
    "    - Implementing a function used to solve the numbers round of Countdown.\n",
    "    - Examples of the function being used.\n",
    "    - AS well as an explanation of any of the functional programming undertaking in the implementation of the solution."
