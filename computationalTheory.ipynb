    "### What is Countdown ?\n",
    "Countdown the game show is a British television game show involving word and number puzzles and mathematical problems. The premise is that contestants must complete various puzzles, often mathematical within a limited amount of time. During this assignment, the mathematical problems portion of this show, also know as the Numbers Round, will focused on.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### The Numbers Round <br/>\n",
    "The Numbers Round of Countdown is a game show that involves solving mathematical problems. The contestants are given six randomly chosen numbers and a set of basic mathemmatical operations to reach a target number or to get as close as that target number as possible within a time limit of 30 seconds.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### The Rules<br/>\n",
    "The round starts off with the contestant selecting six numbers. The contestant can pick two numbers from 1 to 10 and one number each of the numbers 25, 50, 75 and 100. A random integer from 101 to 999 is generated(The Target Number). Once all of the numbers are presented to the contestandts they must reach the trarget number or as get as close to it as possible within the time limit.\n",
    "\n",
    "Although this may seem straight forward at first, there are some additional rules on how you can solve the problem. Firstly, the contestants can use any of the four basic mathematical operations: addition, subtraction, multiplication and division, these operators can be used as many times as the contestant pleases, although using the division operator MUST result in a whole number and likewise subtraction must result in a positive number. Secondly, each number must only be used once in the equation the contestant comes up with to reach solution to the problem.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### The Numbers Round Example:\n",
    "Numbers: 6, 8, 25, 50, 75, 100<br/>\n",

    "Step 2: 6  * 50 = 300<br/>\n",

    "## Computational Complexity Analysis\n",
    "The computational complexity of the numbers round in Countdown will be explored in this section. Factors considered will include the possible combinations when dealing with six random numbers along with the various mathematical operations available, the impact of the target number on the complexity, the impact of the time constraint on the choice of algorithm, as well as a comparison of the different algorithms that could be used to solve the numbers round of the game.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Possible Combinations\n",
    "The numbers round of countdown introduces computational challenggeses that are rooted in combinatorial complexity. But what is combinatorial complexity? Combinatorial complexity, often referred to as a combinatorial explosion, is a mathematical concept that refers to the gowth in complexity of a the problem.\n",
    "In the numbers round of countdown, the number of possible combinations is the number of ways that the six random numbers can be arranged. The cobinatorial complexity comes from all the possible ways that you can combine the operators and numbers and the number number of combinations only grows exponentially with the nimber of numbers given. So in the context of of the numbers round where we have six numbers in the round there are aproximately 40,000 possible combinations that are within the target range for 101 to 999. If we were to take away the constraints that are the rules of the game the number os possbile combinations would increase to 100,000.<br/>\n",

    ")\n",
    "\n",
    "### Impact of Constraints\n",
    "In the numbers round of countdown, there are several constraints that affect the computational complexity of the game. The first constraint is that the target number must be within a range of 101 to 999, (including 101 and 999). The second constraint is that any result recieved from an equation must be a positive integer, no negative or deimal point numbers are permitted.THe third constraint is that each number can only be used once per calculatin. An example of the numbers round following these constraints can bee seen above in the Numbers Round Example. With these constraints that must  be followed by the contestants, they greatly reduce the number of valid expressions that can be formed with the given numbers to reach the target number. Without these constraints, the number of possible expressions that could be greated would increase drastically, leading to a combinatorial explosion.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Time Complexity\n",
    "Another complex factor of the numbers round of countdown is the time complexity of it all.THe time complexity of the of the numbers round comes from the number of possible expressions that can be formed with the given numbers and the possible operators that can be used. With this the time complexity of the problem  grows exponentially.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Comparison of Different Algorithms\n",
    "There are several algorithms employed in tackling the numbers round of Countdown, each with its distinctive features and trade-offs. The following three algorithms represent different approaches to solving this mathematical challenge:\n",

    "The brute force algorithm takes a straightforweard but inefficient approach when it comes to solving the numbers round of countdown. Graham Huttons paper [Functional Pearl - The Countdown problem](https://www.cambridge.org/core/services/aop-cambridge-core/content/view/FCF81E290B194D1ACBF699842D4D4CA5/S0956796801004300a.pdf/the-countdown-problem.pdf) represents a haskell program the generates and evaluates all of the possible expressions of the source numbers given in the problem. The brute-force algorithm exhaustively goes through all of the possible combinations of numbers and operators to generate all of the possible expression while still following the constraints of the game.\n",
    "\n",

    "Haskell is a programming language that is used for both research and industrial applications. It is general-purpose, statically typed, and purely functional.

Haskell's primary implementation is the Glasgow Haskell Compiler. Haskell also features type interface and lazy evaluation.\n",
