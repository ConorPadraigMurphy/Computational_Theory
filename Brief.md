# Computational Theory Assessment - Summer 2023/24

## Purpose
The assessment aims to evaluate students' abilities to:

- Identify difficult computational problems in everyday computing.
- Define common models of computation.
- Design computer programs using various computational paradigms.
- Analyze the complexity of an algorithm.

## Deadline
All elements are due by Tuesday, 30 April 2024.

## Topic
The assessment involves analyzing and solving the numbers round of the TV program Countdown. Contestants use six random numbers and mathematical operations to reach a target number within 30 seconds. The task is to write a Python function, `solve_numbers`, to achieve this.

### What to Submit
- Main branch of a GitHub repository.
- Submit the repository URL via the module page form.
- Repository should contain a single notebook named `countdown.ipynb`.
- Keep the repository tidy and well-structured.

## Assessment Criteria

### Theory Element (40%)
- Clear explanation of the Countdown numbers game.
- Analysis of the computational complexity of the game.
- Explanation of the approach to solving the game.
- Research findings on the problem.

### Implementation Element (40%)
- Implementation of the `solve_numbers` function.
- Examples of using the function.
- Explanation of any functional programming aspects.
- Clear and correct code, appropriate tests, knowledge of different approaches, and clean architecture.

### Presentation Element (20%)
- Tidy repository with no unnecessary items.
- Appropriate README.md.
- Proper .gitignore.
- Well-organized explanations, diagrams, and code in the notebook.

## Marking Scheme
Each of the three elements will be assessed based on the following categories, each carrying equal weight. Good marks require evidence of meeting criteria under each category.

1. **Research**
   - Evidence of research on topics.
   - Appropriate referencing.
   - Building on work in the literature.
   - Comparison to similar work.

2. **Development**
   - Clear, concise, and correct code.
   - Appropriate tests.
   - Demonstrable knowledge of different approaches and algorithms.
   - Clean architecture.

3. **Documentation**
   - Clear explanations in notebooks.
   - Concise comments in code and elsewhere.
   - Appropriate, standard README for a GitHub repository.

4. **Consistency**
   - Tens of commits, each representing a reasonable amount of work.
   - Evidence of reviewing and refactoring.
   - Literature, documentation, and code evidencing work on the assessment.

## Policies and Advice
- Repository should be presentable in job interviews.
- Familiarize yourself with ATU policies and regulations.
- Follow the Policy on Plagiarism and the Student Code of Conduct.
- Seek clarification if in doubt.
- Plan and structure your work; don't start coding immediately.

**Advice (provided on 24 January 2024)**: Students are encouraged to exercise initiative, work independently, source information, and make design decisions. A plan is necessary before starting coding.
